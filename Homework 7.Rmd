#EXPLAIN THE OUTPUT: The series has a recurring seasonal pattern that repeats every s periods, which is addressed by seasonal differencing. After removing seasonality, the present value is influenced by last period’s value (AR 1), the last two noise terms (MA 1 ), seasonal dependence is captured by one lagged seasonal error term (seasonal MA 1).
